      <description>Every Choice is a Tradeoff Everything is a tradeoff, always. The longer I live the more evident this is true. I used to be and still sometimes struggle with being a perfectionist, I like to weigh all the options, see every possibility before committing to a decision, sometimes even going back over it again and rethinking the decision, this has never served me well.
