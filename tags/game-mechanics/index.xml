      <description>Released in 1999, this is one of those games that some people say nothing like it has come out since.
Turn based strategy and role playing game. it&amp;rsquo;s like a primitive city builder, kinda.
backstory choices to create a culture for your team
appointing leaders and advisors the hints they give based on how skilled they are
Personal Thoughts: I expected more combat and less city planning choices.
The focus on the gods and the mythology is interesting, I should incorporate something like that into my game.</description>

      <description>I want to explore the mechanics of Ogre Battle because I want to clone a lot of it&amp;rsquo;s features into a game I&amp;rsquo;m working on. Not a direct clone but heavily inspired by it to the point of almost using it as a template.
Ogre Battle Released on the SNES in 1993 and later for the PSX in 1997, this game named after not one but two Queen songs is one of my favorite games.</description>

      <description>This is the sequel to Ogre Battle and the mechanis are derivative and very similar, so I&amp;rsquo;ll only take notes on what&amp;rsquo;s different.
6 Different Endinges - Very Different
Story Heavy - Lots of World Building Bosses are throwaway bosses
Difference From SNES Game Chapters Sub Missions Take over stronghold, mission requirements mission overview and advice 3x3 grid moves you use, amount of moves, defense, which units can be attack, which units attack you 5 characters to a team, big units count as 2 back and side attacks less moves when in back row more equipment leaderless running away is different already liberated towns, neutral towns and conqured towns some towns resist guard, follow make camp - regain stamina gain new soldiers for winning/strongholds - these are basic units Hugo Report Relationship Tree entering strongholds talk to villagers heavy / light units / Ranged Units magic combo attacks xp from every battle not just kills permadeth of units / witch revives / but squad death is dead item carrying</description>

      <description>One of the most classic computer RPGs made in 1981, I hope to learn a lot as I study the mechanics of this series. Most of this is from watching let&amp;rsquo;s play videos and reading up on the game mostly due to my own frustrations with the UI.
Stats core to the character is it&amp;rsquo;s class and it&amp;rsquo;s stats. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure if what class you choose does much more than to buff certain stats.</description>
