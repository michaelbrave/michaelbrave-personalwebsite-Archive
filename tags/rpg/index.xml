      <description>Released in 1999, this is one of those games that some people say nothing like it has come out since.
Turn based strategy and role playing game. it&amp;rsquo;s like a primitive city builder, kinda.
backstory choices to create a culture for your team
appointing leaders and advisors the hints they give based on how skilled they are
Personal Thoughts: I expected more combat and less city planning choices.
The focus on the gods and the mythology is interesting, I should incorporate something like that into my game.</description>

      <description>One of the most classic computer RPGs made in 1981, I hope to learn a lot as I study the mechanics of this series. Most of this is from watching let&amp;rsquo;s play videos and reading up on the game mostly due to my own frustrations with the UI.
Stats core to the character is it&amp;rsquo;s class and it&amp;rsquo;s stats. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure if what class you choose does much more than to buff certain stats.</description>
