      <title>If It&#39;s Worth Doing Well, It&#39;s Worth Doing Poorly</title>

      <description>I once heard a saying that if &amp;ldquo;something is worth doing well, then it&amp;rsquo;s worth doing poorly&amp;rdquo; in this particular case it was in reference to keeping a diet and was along the lines of &amp;ldquo;done is better than perfect&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;better something than nothing&amp;rdquo;. So keeping with the diet example, every time I&amp;rsquo;ve failed at keeping a diet it&amp;rsquo;s been something along the lines of quitting because &amp;ldquo;I already messed up yesterday&amp;rdquo;, while the times I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to keep a diet were the times I was allowed to make mistakes, or when I had already factored in something like a cheat day.</description>
