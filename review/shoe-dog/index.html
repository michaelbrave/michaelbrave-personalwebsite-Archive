<p>This is a memoir by/for Phil Knight, one of the founders of Nike and covers his life from the time of finishing college until Nike went public. It’s rare that I can read a book that I can’t put down and ends up cutting into my sleep because I just want to read one more chapter or know “what’s going to happen next” or wonder “how are they going to pull that off”.</p>
<p>Immediately I felt a kind of kinship with his 20-something self, how he wanted to travel, his interest in legends and history/philosophy, how he decided to stay in hawaii hanging out with beatniks and surfers, getting a job that gave him time to surf and knowing it was time to move on.</p>
<p>He had this idea that using Japan as an emerging manufacturing hub in the 60’s could allow for high quality shoes, which fit well with his other passion of running track and field. It was surprising to me that Nike started out as an importer before it designed its own brand, and even more surprising was that they didn’t really seek out to create their own brand but rather were somewhat forced into it by their distribution channels being somewhat untrustworthy and unreliable, it was self preservation that lead to one of the strongest brands in the world. I had no idea.</p>
<p>The second part that was surprising was how it felt like they were always about to go out of business, every chapter was a new struggle, a new obstacle, some new problem that threatened everything. I wonder if they had taken some time to grow a little slower if that might have prevented some or most of those problems, but then again if the demand is there then that’s potential money left on the table and I’m not sure what would be the right call for me in a similar situation, but it seems like it turned out ok for them.</p>
<p>I was also impressed with how he managed to recruit people who were head over heels passionate about what they were trying to do. This seemed to be the biggest key to their success according to the book, and  I can only hope that as I move forward in my own endeavors I can do the same.</p>
<p>I only had one critique and that’s that it seemed like the second half of the book had a different writing style to the first half. The first half is a bit more philosophical or poetic and the second half is a bit more full of despair and self criticism. I’m not sure where or how it came to feel that way but it did.</p>
<p>In all I highly recommend it, it’s a good reminder of the struggles that exist when creating a business, I felt like I’ve learned some lessons, gained some wisdom and for the first time in a long time felt like going for a run.</p>
