      <description>This is a memoir by/for Phil Knight, one of the founders of Nike and covers his life from the time of finishing college until Nike went public. It’s rare that I can read a book that I can’t put down and ends up cutting into my sleep because I just want to read one more chapter or know “what’s going to happen next” or wonder “how are they going to pull that off”.</description>

      <description>Part 1 - Ponyo is here Yesterday I was fortunate to find PBS - The Making of Ponyo and it was insightful into the of someone I&amp;rsquo;ve alway looked up to profesionally, Hayao Miyazaki.
I think the best parts weren&amp;rsquo;t the parts they focused on, they were mostly trying to capture his process (which if I&amp;rsquo;m being honest is very similar to video game concept art processes), but what was even better was watching him procrastinate, and search for inspiration and dealing with his own internal doubts.</description>
