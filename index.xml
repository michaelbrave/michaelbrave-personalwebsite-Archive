      <title>Best in What Way, For Who, When?</title>

      <description>Every Choice is a Tradeoff Everything is a tradeoff, always. The longer I live the more evident this is true. I used to be and still sometimes struggle with being a perfectionist, I like to weigh all the options, see every possibility before committing to a decision, sometimes even going back over it again and rethinking the decision, this has never served me well.

      <description>One of the most productive things I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to do has been to cut things out of my life because they weren&amp;rsquo;t the most important. Focus is as much what you don&amp;rsquo;t do as what you do. So it becomes even more important to recognize and prioritize the things that actually matter, especially if these are along the important and impactful but not urgent spectrum.
So then I have to ask myself, what are the things that actually matter?</description>

      <description>Cultivating curiosity and wonder are what allow me to be productive, to get things done and to keep procrastination at bay, I find that they are also core emotions to my functioning well as a person and key my own happiness or contentment.
I believe that the distillation of it is feedback and enjoying that feedback. Look at a baby splashing water, they are surprised by how their actions caused a reaction, they are surprised and often delighted by that direct feedback.</description>

We never achieve things ourselves, we are just a piece of that achievement, your parents raised you, your friends supported you, your society shaped you, you are the core piece, but only a piece, respect and give credit, let them share your accomplishments and achievements because it is theirs too.</description>

      <description>If it Pisses You Off, There’s a Bit Of Truth in it, Usually&amp;hellip;
It hits hard because you know you should have taken care of it already
A hard truth that needs to be faced
This isn’t always true as sometimes it’s just ridiculous that they even suggest it and it’s angering because of how defamatory it is, but if it was truly ridiculous you would probably laugh instead of getting angry.</description>

      <description>Our Flaws Make Us Better - Why It’s Ok for Smart People to Do Dumb Things
I&amp;rsquo;m always shocked when people I admire do dumb things, but never when I do. I don&amp;rsquo;t even look down on them, it&amp;rsquo;s just an “oh, that&amp;rsquo;s odd”. We are all just human. It&amp;rsquo;s better this way

      <description>Relationships and Related Defining Love  What Is Love?  Jon and watching his daughter grow Why I feel loss from distance The need for individuality, love requires friction else it’s an object/slave relationship  Seeing people as people and not just what they can do for you   Often we choose what is familiar instead of what is good for you - some people like to be treated poorly and would be suspicious if you treated them well People who feel like home love shouldn’t have constraints, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit in a box, it’s not negative or fearful, it’s opposite is shame Love is perfect kindness Opening of the heart is the beginning of love There can be many paths and kinds of love, it’s not a hierarchy of strength but different things for different people at different times 2.</description>

Goodbyes as an Act of Love - Ash and freeing his pokemon, because he really cared about them
You can’t trust anything to be there tomorrow, people leave or die, currency loses value, governments fail, websites disappear

It reframes the conflict, now it’s real
The reframing loss/death
These are moments given to us to now choose a path, there is pain, but there is also options of play, we always have some choice to make.
Tragedy is When Poor Choices Are Made, and Consequences Cascade From it

      <title>If It&#39;s Worth Doing Well, It&#39;s Worth Doing Poorly</title>
      <link>https://michaelbrave.github.io/note/do-it-poorly/</link>

      <guid>https://michaelbrave.github.io/note/do-it-poorly/</guid>
      <description>I once heard a saying that if &amp;ldquo;something is worth doing well, then it&amp;rsquo;s worth doing poorly&amp;rdquo; in this particular case it was in reference to keeping a diet and was along the lines of &amp;ldquo;done is better than perfect&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;better something than nothing&amp;rdquo;. So keeping with the diet example, every time I&amp;rsquo;ve failed at keeping a diet it&amp;rsquo;s been something along the lines of quitting because &amp;ldquo;I already messed up yesterday&amp;rdquo;, while the times I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to keep a diet were the times I was allowed to make mistakes, or when I had already factored in something like a cheat day.</description>

      <description>This is a memoir by/for Phil Knight, one of the founders of Nike and covers his life from the time of finishing college until Nike went public. It’s rare that I can read a book that I can’t put down and ends up cutting into my sleep because I just want to read one more chapter or know “what’s going to happen next” or wonder “how are they going to pull that off”.</description>

      <title>Build in the open</title>

      <guid>https://michaelbrave.github.io/note/build-in-the-open/</guid>
      <description>Why have my notes be public? This is in large part due to two different ideas.
The first is that building in the open aka building with the garage door open allows for better feedback loops with other people. People can tell me where/how I&amp;rsquo;m wrong, maybe my wisdom/failing can help someone else, those who are curious about me can know what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking and instead of having something private I can instead be building a kind of resource that could create a kind of creation momentum.</description>

      <description>Released in 1999, this is one of those games that some people say nothing like it has come out since.
Turn based strategy and role playing game. it&amp;rsquo;s like a primitive city builder, kinda.
backstory choices to create a culture for your team
appointing leaders and advisors the hints they give based on how skilled they are
Personal Thoughts: I expected more combat and less city planning choices.
The focus on the gods and the mythology is interesting, I should incorporate something like that into my game.</description>

      <description>I want to explore the mechanics of Ogre Battle because I want to clone a lot of it&amp;rsquo;s features into a game I&amp;rsquo;m working on. Not a direct clone but heavily inspired by it to the point of almost using it as a template.
Ogre Battle Released on the SNES in 1993 and later for the PSX in 1997, this game named after not one but two Queen songs is one of my favorite games.</description>

      <description>This is the sequel to Ogre Battle and the mechanis are derivative and very similar, so I&amp;rsquo;ll only take notes on what&amp;rsquo;s different.
6 Different Endinges - Very Different
Story Heavy - Lots of World Building Bosses are throwaway bosses
Difference From SNES Game Chapters Sub Missions Take over stronghold, mission requirements mission overview and advice 3x3 grid moves you use, amount of moves, defense, which units can be attack, which units attack you 5 characters to a team, big units count as 2 back and side attacks less moves when in back row more equipment leaderless running away is different already liberated towns, neutral towns and conqured towns some towns resist guard, follow make camp - regain stamina gain new soldiers for winning/strongholds - these are basic units Hugo Report Relationship Tree entering strongholds talk to villagers heavy / light units / Ranged Units magic combo attacks xp from every battle not just kills permadeth of units / witch revives / but squad death is dead item carrying</description>

      <description>Part 1 - Ponyo is here Yesterday I was fortunate to find PBS - The Making of Ponyo and it was insightful into the of someone I&amp;rsquo;ve alway looked up to profesionally, Hayao Miyazaki.
I think the best parts weren&amp;rsquo;t the parts they focused on, they were mostly trying to capture his process (which if I&amp;rsquo;m being honest is very similar to video game concept art processes), but what was even better was watching him procrastinate, and search for inspiration and dealing with his own internal doubts.</description>

      <description>One of the most classic computer RPGs made in 1981, I hope to learn a lot as I study the mechanics of this series. Most of this is from watching let&amp;rsquo;s play videos and reading up on the game mostly due to my own frustrations with the UI.
Stats core to the character is it&amp;rsquo;s class and it&amp;rsquo;s stats. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure if what class you choose does much more than to buff certain stats.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m what happens when you take an artist, turn them into a designer and then later a developer.
My lifelong mission (other than finding the perfect lemonaide) is to use technology to make better and cheaper art. This explains my interests in Neural Networks (especially being used to create things), it&amp;rsquo;s why I love things like procedural generation, and It&amp;rsquo;s why I get excited about game engines being used in ways other than for making games.</description>

      <description>June 2020
Learning:
I&amp;rsquo;m learning how to make a game using Unreal Engine 4. I&amp;rsquo;m making something that&amp;rsquo;s a spiritual successor to Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen for SNES, but with RTS elements and a customizable AI Gambit System (like Final Fantasy 12 or Dragon Age).
I&amp;rsquo;ve also started working through Harvard CS50 again as I never finished it and would like to.

I&amp;rsquo;m reading &amp;ldquo;Procedural Storytelling in Game Design&amp;rdquo; by Tanya X.</description>
