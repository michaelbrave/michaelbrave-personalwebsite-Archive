      <title>If It&#39;s Worth Doing Well, It&#39;s Worth Doing Poorly</title>

      <description>I once heard a saying that if &amp;ldquo;something is worth doing well, then it&amp;rsquo;s worth doing poorly&amp;rdquo; in this particular case it was in reference to keeping a diet and was along the lines of &amp;ldquo;done is better than perfect&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;better something than nothing&amp;rdquo;. So keeping with the diet example, every time I&amp;rsquo;ve failed at keeping a diet it&amp;rsquo;s been something along the lines of quitting because &amp;ldquo;I already messed up yesterday&amp;rdquo;, while the times I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to keep a diet were the times I was allowed to make mistakes, or when I had already factored in something like a cheat day.</description>

      <title>Build in the open</title>

      <description>Why have my notes be public? This is in large part due to two different ideas.
The first is that building in the open aka building with the garage door open allows for better feedback loops with other people. People can tell me where/how I&amp;rsquo;m wrong, maybe my wisdom/failing can help someone else, those who are curious about me can know what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking and instead of having something private I can instead be building a kind of resource that could create a kind of creation momentum.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I was fortunate to find PBS - The Making of Ponyo and it was insightful into the of someone I&amp;rsquo;ve alway looked up to profesionally, Hayao Miyazaki.
I think the best parts weren&amp;rsquo;t the parts they focused on, they were mostly trying to capture his process (which if I&amp;rsquo;m being honest is very similar to video game concept art processes), but what was even better was watching him procrastinate, and search for inspiration and dealing with his own internal doubts.</description>

      <title>Ogre Battle - Game Mechanics Study</title>

      <description>I want to explore the mechanics of Ogre Battle because I want to clone a lot of it&amp;rsquo;s features into a game I&amp;rsquo;m working on. Not a direct clone but heavily inspired by almost like using this game as a template or a foundation.
Ogre Battle Released on the SNES in 1993 and later for the PSX in 1997, this game named after not one but two Queen songs is one of my favorite games.</description>
