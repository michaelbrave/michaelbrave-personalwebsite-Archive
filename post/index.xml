      <description>I want to explore the mechanics of Ogre Battle because I want to clone a lot of it&amp;rsquo;s features into a game I&amp;rsquo;m working on. Not a direct clone but heavily inspired by it to the point of almost using it as a template.
Ogre Battle Released on the SNES in 1993 and later for the PSX in 1997, this game named after not one but two Queen songs is one of my favorite games.</description>

      <description>One of the most classic computer RPGs made in 1981, I hope to learn a lot as I study the mechanics of this series. Most of this is from watching let&amp;rsquo;s play videos and reading up on the game mostly due to my own frustrations with the UI.
Stats core to the character is it&amp;rsquo;s class and it&amp;rsquo;s stats. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure if what class you choose does much more than to buff certain stats.</description>
