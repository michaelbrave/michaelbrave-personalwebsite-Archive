A Good Photograph is When I Would Rather Look at The Photo Than The Initial Subject Similar to the medium is the message but rather it&amp;rsquo;s more about choosing which medium would best represent what you wanted to get out of it.</description>

      <description>Relationships and Related Defining Love  What Is Love?  Jon and watching his daughter grow Why I feel loss from distance The need for individuality, love requires friction else it’s an object/slave relationship  Seeing people as people and not just what they can do for you   Often we choose what is familiar instead of what is good for you - some people like to be treated poorly and would be suspicious if you treated them well People who feel like home love shouldn’t have constraints, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit in a box, it’s not negative or fearful, it’s opposite is shame Love is perfect kindness Opening of the heart is the beginning of love There can be many paths and kinds of love, it’s not a hierarchy of strength but different things for different people at different times 2.</description>

      <description>Released in 1999, this is one of those games that some people say nothing like it has come out since.
Turn based strategy and role playing game. it&amp;rsquo;s like a primitive city builder, kinda.
backstory choices to create a culture for your team
appointing leaders and advisors the hints they give based on how skilled they are
Personal Thoughts: I expected more combat and less city planning choices.
The focus on the gods and the mythology is interesting, I should incorporate something like that into my game.</description>

      <description>Pulling from the following genres
RTS SRPG/Tactical Action RPG MOBA Building/Community Sim AutoBattler/Autochess Survival
overworld rts like ogre battle (see also dragon age map) see also rimworld map
combat mode star ocean dragon age mobas Auto Battlers
Base Building should be able to access all menus from the map. No need to go into deeper detail. Each town has slots for industries and will bring you resources etc. Shops and blacksmiths have levels, you can pay/invest in them as upgrade tiers.</description>
