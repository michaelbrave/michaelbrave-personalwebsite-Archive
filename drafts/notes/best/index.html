<h2 id="every-choice-is-a-tradeoff">Every Choice is a Tradeoff<a class="anchor" href="#every-choice-is-a-tradeoff">#</a></h2>
<p>Everything is a tradeoff, always. The longer I live the more evident this is true. I used to be and still sometimes struggle with being a perfectionist, I like to weigh all the options, see every possibility before committing to a decision, sometimes even going back over it again and rethinking the decision, this has never served me well.</p>
<p>“A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week” — George Patton</p>
<p>This is one of those wisdoms I&rsquo;ve known a long time but it never really sank in until lately.</p>
<h2 id="examples-from-ux">Examples From UX<a class="anchor" href="#examples-from-ux">#</a></h2>
<p>A good software UX example, I could design something with &ldquo;all the pieces out&rdquo; philosophy which is great for power users, but can be overwhelming for new users for whom optimizing for most used features being up front and center and the least used tucked away and hidden until needed. There&rsquo;s a balance.</p>
<p>Similarly when something is established the previous users have expectations and to deviate too much from those expectations will alienate those users even if it&rsquo;s an improvement for most people, or even necissary to onboard new users.</p>
<h2 id="technology-isnt-superior-without-adoption">Technology Isn&rsquo;t Superior Without Adoption<a class="anchor" href="#technology-isnt-superior-without-adoption">#</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes I would be tempted to try a new technology or even make my own tools. But is designing something new worth it when 98% of what I wanted to do can be done with what&rsquo;s already there? But it goes deeper, what if a tech stack isn&rsquo;t as efficient but it lends itself to better architecture and can be better understood, what about having a user base or a community, having proper documentaiton and tutorials, a potential labor pool, or people excited to use it?</p>
<p>I remember when I first learned that some products that weren&rsquo;t technically superior lost out to other technologies that were either cheaper or had better marketing. My gut reacion was disapoinment, but as I&rsquo;ve gotten older I&rsquo;ve begun to realize that this is almost the same arugment I&rsquo;ve had with friends about hiring talented tech people with social skills over those with superior technical skills who can&rsquo;t work well in teams. If we choose a technology that doesn&rsquo;t play well with the rest of our requirments (like business concerns, recruiting, communnity, adoption) then it doesn&rsquo;t actually solve our problem very well does it. Technical solutions aren&rsquo;t just technical problems, there are people, society and business concerns mixed in there.</p>
<h2 id="every-possibility-cant-be-seen">Every Possibility Can&rsquo;t Be Seen<a class="anchor" href="#every-possibility-cant-be-seen">#</a></h2>
<p>The most ironic thing about all of this is that my trying to see every possibility was impossible anyway, I don&rsquo;t have enough time in the world to read every book I want to let alone to see and understand every possibility.</p>
<h2 id="theories-without-testing-are-worse-than-useless">Theories Without Testing Are Worse Than Useless<a class="anchor" href="#theories-without-testing-are-worse-than-useless">#</a></h2>
<p>Besides most peoples theoretical solutions don&rsquo;t float until they&rsquo;ve gotten some tweaking based on feedback from expiramenting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody Has a Plan Until They Get Punched in the Mouth&rdquo; - Mike Tyson</p>
<p>Again this is something I&rsquo;ve known a long time due to my design background, the need for feedback as early in the process as possible is huge when making something new, but I didn&rsquo;t realize how true it was for probably everything. This is why we build small first, why we get feedback asap and why we expirament first.</p>
<h2 id="who-and-what-matter-more-than-how-especially-with-iteration-or-evolution">Who and What Matter More Than How, Especially With Iteration or Evolution<a class="anchor" href="#who-and-what-matter-more-than-how-especially-with-iteration-or-evolution">#</a></h2>
<p>This opens another question though, since nothing can be the best and can only be optimized for certain groups, use cases and meeting certain requirements, then it&rsquo;s fair to say that the how matters less than I thought, but the who and what matter much much more.</p>
