<h2 id="defining-love">Defining Love</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>What Is Love?</strong>
<ol>
<li>Jon and watching his daughter grow</li>
<li>Why I feel loss from distance</li>
<li>The need for individuality, love requires friction else it’s an object/slave relationship
<ol>
<li>Seeing people as people and not just what they can do for you</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Often we choose what is familiar instead of what is good for you - some people like to be treated poorly and would be suspicious if you treated them well</li>
<li>People who feel like home</li>
<li>love shouldn’t have constraints, it doesn&rsquo;t fit in a box, it’s not negative or fearful, it’s opposite is shame</li>
<li>Love is perfect kindness</li>
<li>Opening of the heart is the beginning of love</li>
<li>There can be many paths and kinds of love, it’s not a hierarchy of strength but different things for different people at different times
2. What about familiarity and mutual interests?
3. Love without expectations
4. This doesn’t mean I need to marry you, or we need to be together forever. It doesn’t even mean that you have to love me, now or ever. But I want you to know that you make me feel this way, and I am lucky that you are here with me right now.</li>
<li>Love isn’t created it’s discovered</li>
<li>“Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own.” -Robert Heinlein.</li>
<li>&ldquo;love is something you do, not something you feel&rdquo;. Also, &ldquo;love is when you value someone (or sometimes something) else as much as you value yourself.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The pop-culture idea of &ldquo;falling in love&rdquo; is just hormones and curiosity and adventure.
5. “Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove. O no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wand&rsquo;ring bark, Whose worth&rsquo;s unknown, although his height be taken.&rdquo; -William Shakespeare
6. The Mythology of romantic love and the history of chivalry - basically our cultural expectation of what it is, is all a lie
7. The romantic ideals are a pursuit of beauty, but ultimately catastrophic</li>
<li>Love is education and growth, with best interests in mind, a sort of co-growth, it’s not love if it isn’t followed by action</li>
<li>Total acceptance is dumb, unconditional might be a ridiculous requirement</li>
<li>“attraction without commitment is not love; it is only desire.” -Glen Sharp</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Apathy Is The Opposite of Love, Hatred is Love’s Cousin</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="first-get-your-own-shit-together">First Get Your Own Shit Together</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Self Love - I Know You, I See You, I Want You, I Love You</strong>
17. it is enough, my love for you is enough, you are enough, wanting a thing is enough of a reason, wanting to exist is enough of a reason, the smallest chance of wanting a reason later is enough of a reason to keep going.</li>
<li><strong>On Being Seen - Do You See Yourself, Do You See Others?</strong>
18. “to be known without being loved is a terrible thing. While to be loved without being known is crushing. But to be deeply known and deeply loved is transformationally healing” - Killian Noe</li>
<li><strong>Mirroring Yourself In Others, When Is Right, When Is Wrong</strong>
19. “I&rsquo;ll just treat you like your broke like me” - Positive
20. Assuming they are motivated by the same as you - Negative</li>
<li><strong>Quit Worrying About This Shit - Just Live Your Life And Be Awesome</strong>
21. People only want you when you don’t need them - relationships only happen when you are self sufficient, VC’s only come if you are already making money or proven. - Conclusion, you don’t need them, but if you want them to enhance what is already awesome, then that is a strategy</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-complexities-of-romance">The Complexities of Romance</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Catching Feelings - A Theory of Attraction</strong>
<ol>
<li>Time Spent Together</li>
<li>Proximity</li>
<li>Shared Experiences</li>
<li>Enjoyment</li>
<li>Planting A Seed</li>
<li>Dead doesn’t come back to life, no second chances, maybe new chances with the same person, but no second chances. It’s a new spark not reviving a flame.</li>
<li>A lot of what I find attractive are actually just socio-economic indicators</li>
<li>Physical attraction can be broken down into
<ol>
<li>Health indicators
<ol>
<li>Symmetry</li>
<li>Fitness</li>
<li>Hair Quality</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Youth indicators
4. Big eyes
5. Soft Skin</li>
<li>Fertility Indicators
6. Hip ratio
7. Lip Fullness</li>
<li>Status Signalling
8. Height
9. Fashion
10. Jewelry
11. Language</li>
<li>After all of that is some personal taste
12. A lot of which has to do with upbringing and culture.
13. Like how I like interesting eyes</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>To Commit or Not To Commit</strong>
9. When Committed - Even if Angry, you do not go and seek someone else&rsquo;s attention. You sit your ass there and make it right!
10. If you are committed you don’t leave if there&rsquo;s an argument, you come back and work it out.</li>
<li><strong>Relationship Economics</strong>
11. The market of relationships, moving into a service market? Economies shaping our love lives? We have to be an experience and a performance for loved ones? I’m not sure it should be this way, could I find someone that would prefer me to be a safe space to put away the mask instead, a refuge from the expectations of society? I think I would prefer that, if our space isn’t a performance space. I’m not sure how to put that into words yet.
6. Most of our presence online or even in person is performance, showing off, it could be exhausting, it is exhausting, I think this loving refuge hypothesis might be true
7. I don’t want to have to try to impress someone who is a partner, I want instead a quiet steadiness rather than a blur of activity.
12. Being with similar level of attractive people to reduce friction of the relationship, so leagues don’t exist persay, but large differences of value do cause friction
13. Often we self select by acting like there are leagues, I have missed many opportunities with women I was attracted to because I felt intimidated by how attractive I found them.
14. If someone is attractive, other people are more willing to put up with their bullshit, which gives them more leeway and immunity to the consequences of bad behavior</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility</strong>
15. Compatibility is achieved later, not a prerequisite for love (see arranged marriages and success rates)
16. It’s almost like working out a contract.</li>
<li><strong>Why Do You Even Want a Relationship or Partnership?</strong>
17. Simple validation isn’t enough of a thing to want
18. The only reason to partner in business or relationship is because you can grow faster or do more together than you could alone
8. Good VC’s offer more than money, in dating a good SO would be more than just love
9. Do you want VC funding because you want validation? Is dating the same?
10. What could you create together that you couldn’t create yourself?
11. Partner with people who will guide you, kick your ass, help you, fill in your blind spots, strengthen your weaknesses,</li>
<li><strong>Depth of Admiration, Polarization Produces Better Relationships</strong>
19. To be loved by all but shallowly is a type of non-existence, to be loved deeply by a smaller group and hated by others is better, because then it is real.
20. Stand for something, have a niche.</li>
<li><strong>What Sexyness Is</strong>
21. The attitude and belief of it “I know I’m sexy, and my knowing it let’s the world know it too”
22. It’s an invitation to be free with yourself, to be more yourself, a way to break away from shame
23. To summarize, it’s an invitation of freedom.</li>
<li><strong>People Have Sex, It’s Super Normal, None of Us Would Exist If People Didn’t, So Stop Acting Like It’s Weird, Stop Feeling Shame About It</strong>
24. In fact, very few people stick to monogamous relationships even
25. History is littered with examples of infidelity, arrangements, polygamy, harems
26. Our shame about this is societal, a form of control, you are drinking the kool aid
27. Living without shame of sex is a beautiful thing</li>
<li><strong>Intimacy Is Not Necessarily Sex, Words Can Be Too</strong>
28. Some of my most vulnerable and intimate moments have been with people who I never wanted to be naked with.</li>
<li><strong>A Romantic Partner is Just a Friend You Want to Do Private Naked Things With</strong>
29. Unless it’s a life partner in which there is another separate layer that is often conflated
30. Treat a woman your attracted to like a friend, who you just so happen to want to do private stuff with, That’s all
31. Stop putting so much pressure on these things
32. There are all kinds of levels of inbetween, just as there are many kinds of friends in your life who have different kinds of roles.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="societal-complexity-and-redefining-how-to-be">Societal Complexity and Redefining How To Be</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Positive Masculinity Is To Be Giving, Machismo Is Taking</strong>
<ol>
<li>You give what only you can give, an experience only you can provide, you can only do this when you are honest. If you give too much of yourself usually it manifests in the ways that are not unique to you, so you will waste yourself on the things that don’t matter, become exhausted by it and then the unique things you offer will suffer from lack of attention, effort, time and focus</li>
<li>Machismo - is there a motivation for them to learn from feminists and good men?
<ol>
<li>They may not see the value in it, if they are thinking from a purely “what can I gain from this standpoint” there may not be a lot to offer them actually because dating is arguably harder for those who give a shit, but I would argue that life would be more fulfilling and the relationships that are made would be more fulfilling</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>“Treat Women Like Shit, They Love It” I want to disagree so strongly, and yet he has more women attracted to him than I do, so I do not have an answer.</li>
<li>Why do some women support the institutions that oppress them and fall for men who treat them poorly? - See Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Empathy For Those on Pedestals</strong>
5. it sucks, the pressure, expectations and just how it&rsquo;s not a real relationship, it is a distorted echo of who you think they are</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability &amp; Honesty of Intent</strong>
6. Hitting on people is different than flirting, one is broadcast the other is a conversation
2. Don’t engage in conversations that people don’t want to engage in, then you are just talking/yelling at them, no joy in it
7. Vulnerability is the truest sign of strength, it allows attacks to come and to survive them intact, unmarred and possibly even stronger than before
8. Vulnerability will not be seen as a strength unless it’s accompanied by competence and achievement first, otherwise it could look like complaining, there is an effective way to communicate it and not, but mostly it needs to be authentic
9. Whining is not the same as openness
10. Taking Chances is letting yourself be vulnerable
11. Trust is a leap of faith
12. Compliments are expressing yourself - If you think someone is sexy and you have the right rapport, tell them maybe</li>
<li>**Generosity, Love as a Giving Act - The Cure For Superficial **
13. Superficial is to want to get something out of it instead of giving to it
14. To give without expectation, people can feel the difference just like how you can kind of hear people smiling on the phone.</li>
<li><strong>Ambiguous Relationships Are The Ones That Hurt - Clarity Is The Opposite of Passive Aggressive</strong>
15. the opposite of clarity, it is passive aggressive, clear communication is better and more effective, say what you think goes without saying</li>
<li><strong>Awkwardness is Dishonesty Manifested</strong>
16. We are awkward because there is an information block, things we are avoiding saying. Things that probably will hurt, things that may not be able to heal later. To ignore it though is a slow death of the friendship. The truth would be a mercy kill, instead of them wondering why something beautiful died.
17. This is the problem with nice guys, they are dishonest, they are attracted but act like they are not, so they freeze up in conversation, and the awkwardness is felt until eventually it becomes destructive.</li>
<li><strong>They Know Already, They Always Do</strong>
18. (talking about women and if they know I’m interested before I say anything)
19. People can sense your motives, you broadcast it like an aura</li>
<li><strong>Creepiness is Dishonesty of Motives &amp; Inability to Accept Reality</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-darkness-and-the-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel">The Darkness and The Light At The End of The Tunnel</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Loneliness and How To Solve It</strong>
<ol>
<li>If you feel left out from events, you should start throwing your own and being proactive to connect with others and show an interest in the types of events you want to go to</li>
<li>I think part of why I like to travel is because then the loneliness makes sense, when I’m around people I know and still feel lonely, it’s frustrating and feels like my life is wrong, that I am wrong somehow. But if I am away, am not staying put and moving on day by day, then I have a reason, an excuse, a logic to my life and so the loneliness isn’t so bad for a while, you make new friends quickly, gain things to talk about etc, it gives me a justification for it so it hurts less</li>
<li>Volunteer, reach out, help someone, this is a bandaid fix for loneliness</li>
<li>Leverage hobbies</li>
<li>It’s ok if people are just temporary friends, as you get older this is more common.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>On Neediness, Jealousy And Other Shadows Of Love</strong>
6. Looking for a relationship when you’re lonely is like grocery shopping when you’re hungry. It’s easy to be tempted to bring home unfulfilling, unhealthy junk
7. Mistaking loneliness for love, or worse infatuation
8. Would I want to be around her if I wasn’t horny?
9. Did you really love her or was it just convenient?
10. Love is a beautiful thing, this is reason enough to not be jealous
11. No Longer Jealous for the lack of her love
1. Jealous of Tiffany not for her love but that she is ahead of me in career, instead of angry or hurt I feel motivated, not to tear her down, but to rise above, and really it’s ok, it’s cool if we both succeed, it’s cool if she does more than me, but I may try a little harder now just to feel a little smug</li>
<li><strong>What I’ve Learned From Poly People - Trust &amp; Room To Be Ourselves</strong>
12. The most precious gift I’ve ever been given, has been the space to be truly myself, these are moments and people I will treasure always, this is a gift I can also give
13. The level of honesty about everything is refreshing, I don’t think I’ll ever go poly but the way they are honest about things is something I hope to emulate.</li>
<li><strong>People Don’t Belong To People - Ownership Is a Mindset, It Doesn’t Actually Exist</strong>
14. The very concept of owning a person is wrong, and to do it to one that you love? Much more so.</li>
<li><strong>Attentive Love, Healthy Love and What That Looks Like</strong>
15. I’m still figuring this out</li>
<li><strong>Toxic Relationships</strong>
16. Being too helpful, is patronizing
17. People who take out their feelings on others
18. Giving Too Much, at the expense of yourself
19. Needing too much
20. Being unappreciative</li>
<li><strong>Boundaries and a Sense of Self</strong></li>
<li><strong>Familiarity and Contempt, Loving Them Anyway</strong></li>
<li><strong>Betrayal</strong>
21. Is a kind of death as it destroys and changes things
22.  how it mirrors death and life cycles in the hero&rsquo;s journey</li>
<li><strong>Grass Is Greener, Or The Mistress Paradox</strong>
23. The mistress paradox - you don’t have to see them take out the trash, the bias of it
2. Similarly in hiring or coworkers etc
3. By Not having to deal with the day to day they seem better, but all you would do is trade your day to day for another if you left, you are only attracted to a mistress because they are one, shifting the spouse position would carry with it similar problems as before, only now you’ve betrayed the first spouse.</li>

<li><strong>I Have a History of Dating Incredible Women</strong>

<li>Do not discount your life experiences or belittle the people you’ve valued by not valuing yourself in a similar light. Your lack of confidence is a disservice to you, to those you could be involved with and with anyone else who has ever loved or cared about you.</li>

<li><strong>Networking - Finding People To Fill Your Life</strong>
4. You don’t have to go to an event, you can just be around an event
1. Go to the bars around GDC since you can’t afford GDC
5. Low bar of entry or high, do you want depth or breadth of connections
6. There are always people who facilitate deals, you just have to know who to find and know if it’s worth it to use them</li>
<li><strong>Building and Maintaining Community</strong>
7. Small “asks” build collective goodwill, in marriages and communities. When you stop answering it shows that you don’t care.
8. Community is the building of collective culture, shared experiences, shaped by the layout, location and people involved
2. Conforming to the norms of the culture, becoming one with and shaped by the community around them, the influences of those around us and the things that help shape them
3. Being recognized as part of the tribe
4. The Design of Social Interaction Layout - Distance, boundaries, groupings and flow
5. Watering Hole Theory - Gathering around a shared social resource
6. Environments conducive to impromptu conversations
7. Cramped quarters make people talk to each other?
8. Familiarity leads to trust
9. Visibility leads to familiarity
10. Noticable is a way to be visible, as is positioning
11. Proximity norms communicate information
12. Like using the urinal farthest from the other user</li>
<li><strong>Accepting Help Builds Relationships, Denying Help Selfish</strong>

<li>**When I Want to Run Away **
4. A lot of my wanting to travel is to run away, to flee when things got hard or friends went from charming to frustrating. Instead of being open about boundaries and actually trying my best. I wanted to run to save face from failing to avoid the hard thing and the hard conversation. This means I shouldn&rsquo;t go to Turkey or China, not this year, not until my heart is in the right place and that I&rsquo;m going toward something and not away from something else. So it&rsquo;s time to get serious and to have those hard conversations with my friends and myself, it&rsquo;s time to be deeply honest and to communicate with intention. But mostly to actually try, to get serious enough that I truly gave my all, so far I have not. I could have done more

<li><strong>Why Do I Hesitate - Breaking Free of The Forever Beginner Syndrome</strong>
16. Does perfect information exist? What would that look like?
17. What is possible with the resources at hand?
18. Were you chasing a fantasy of perfect information?
19. Or choose the option that does the job, the first viable option and worry about optimizing later
20. Minmax is the enemy, optimization and frictionless are the enemy
21. hesitation is fear again, see perfectionism
22. Paradox of choice?
23. Get rid of rationalization
24. If it is the same no matter the decision then it is still right to do (like weight loss)
25. Set constraints
2. Deadlines
3. Default options
4. Negative consequences for failure to act (cold showers, money bets, anti charities)
26. Exposure therapy to starting and working and finishing?
27. Small tasks to manage unpleasantness
28. Doubting your choices is due to trying to minmax, the only question that should be answered is “did it fulfill the need, did it work”
29. Go with the option that fills the need first.
30. Comparison with others is tied to minmax, again “did it work or did it not”
31. Have an objective, an actual goal - review that goal
32. Experiment, Test and iterate, you know how to do this
33. Start before you feel ready, before you are qualified, before you are prepared
5. If you have enough to get started, you have enough
34. Even making the right choice doesn’t guarantee success and making a sub optimal one doesn’t mean failure, it is what follows that matters, the momentum of many tiny choices that matter more than the large ones
35. Be ok with being wrong, wasting time and being tricked
36. Have other people provide both feedback and accountability
6. You can change your mind later, it’s cool
37. Very related to the fear of missing out
38. Be comfortable being uncomfortable
39. Small bits - if you buy cheap mistakes don’t cause too much pain
40. Remove emotions from the decision making - emotions help you to gloss over flaws, ignore certain important details, or be too harsh based on what’s happened recently
41. Ask a mentor for advice
42. When you can’t be sure how accurate the numbers are be conservative</li>

<h2 id="the-things-i-would-give-anything-to-change">The Things I Would Give Anything To Change</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Being Able to Do the Boring Maintenance Things Consistently</strong>
<ol>
<li>To Be Able To Keep A Diet, To Work Out Everyday, To Check My Mail Consistently</li>
<li>To Keep In Touch Regularly</li>
<li>Why is this so hard for me?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Why Don’t I Keep In Touch Better?</strong>
4. I actually like people, so why don’t I like keeping in touch? Why is email a pain, why is social media painful, why is taking the time to text so hard? What is it that blocks me?
1. Social media is hard because it reminds me that I miss people
1. Especially former romances and crushes who have moved on and are happy, even though I want them to be happy, I still miss them - true with friends too
2. Especially when my friends are living successful lives, the normal template of success at least, and I feel that I am not, my template is far from normal now
3. Perhaps the larger problem is that I am comparing myself with others, even though I don’t want the same things
2. Email just feels overwhelming, I need a way to cut it into smaller pieces
4. Idea to group all messages by sender, micro inboxes like text messages
3. I don’t text because I don’t want to bother people, maybe if there was just an agreement between us that no response was needed that would be enough to fix it
5. Because I’m never mad when I get a “thinking of you text”
6. My only concern is if it’s from someone that I worry might be attracted to me and I don’t want the hassle of that.
7. Not true, there are annoying people too, which is why I didn’t add Slovo for so long on linkedin
8. I worry about that more with women, I worry that I am the one they are worried about having to push away advances from
1. Why am I sometimes unconfident like this? Every woman I’ve dated was really into me, I’m not ugly, I’m actually a decent person, funny, charming, passionate, well read, so what the hell man?
9. I probably am annoying sometimes, on the whole I think most people enjoy me though
5. But still I push people away, especially the people I actually care about, it’s like once they pass a certain closeness threshold I instinctively move away from that closeness.
4. This thread <a href="https://twitter.com/samdylanfinch/status/1112075410697674752">https://twitter.com/samdylanfinch/status/1112075410697674752</a>
5. Suggests that people pleasing is a coping mechanism to trauma similar to fight or flight or freeze, but instead is fawn
6. There is something there perhaps, my childhood was kinda messed up, and my relationships all my life have almost launched and then not quite fully reached it, almost everyone I’ve been close to I still consider close but we barely talk now, and I do still miss them and still want them in my life and yet hesitate at the same time
6. How do I get the results I want and need instead of just spinning emotional wheels here
7. I need to take care of this, I’m having social withdrawals and it’s distracting me from getting things done, it’s also making me less helpful, because I want something, double true with women, because I do want something and that neediness, people can feel it, thus further distancing what would have otherwise been an incredible friendship
8. I’m not ok, and I don’t have any leads or ideas about how to fix this
9. Ambivalent relationships, where we are still friends but haven&rsquo;t spoken in awhile, potentially more toxic than having actually closed it
10. If you love something you are making you don’t give up on it, you improve it, because it’s worth it. I think the core of most of this is not loving myself enough, and not understanding what love is or how it works enough to implement it. This is where to start I think.
11. Guilt about imperfection can block even others giving you feedback, the tone you set will determine what can happen</li>
<li><strong>True Honesty Is Asking For What You Want</strong>
12. This is how I betray myself the most, I ignore my own feelings for what I perceive to be the feelings of others, and so I feel incongruent, and out of integrity with myself</li>

10. Charting your own destiny, your own course. I want to chart my own course, so much of my life I’ve followed friends and it’s ended up well, but I want to see where my own path goes for once
11. I do not want to just be able to accept what is offered, I want to earn something. Not just date someone because it’s convenient but choose to be together. Not just have a career that I’ve fallen into but one that I made my own.</li>

16. This is the value of coding everyday, not just for practice, but to become

<li><strong>Living Without Fear</strong>
2. “To dare is to do.. To fear is to fail” - John Goddard
3. Is it fear or excitement? We often conflate the two

5. Take action, and the fear will dissipate</li>
<li><strong>Living Without Shame  - Living With Love and Courage</strong>
6. Teegan Spitting at The Idea of Shame
7. Shame is a Selfish Act, instilling shame for a cultural norm is worse than selfish, it’s traumatic
8. When you live courageously, freely and without shame it allows you to give more, to be more, to brighten the days of others. Love and courage are selfless acts (what else could be selfless? Being sexy? Being successful?)</li>
<li><strong>Living Without Regret</strong>
9. How could I have done differently? I was me, and it lead me here.</li>
<li><strong>Living With Intent, Designing My Life Instead of Opting For Defaults</strong>
10. “I want you to think” - John the old cowboy
11. Design is intent and communication
12. Design is to do things with forethought and intent, to actually make choices instead of going with the default or stumbling forward
1. How many of my choices were made based on what was available instead of what I actually wanted? My skills, careers, love life, friendships, most of it</li>
<li><strong>Ego Is The Enemy of Progress and Productivity</strong>
13. Perfectionism is only harmful, there is no benefit
14. See also “go ugly early”
15. Inhibitions hold you back “just dance man, it’s ok”
16. Being present with what is instead of what you wish it was</li>
<li><strong>On Pride and Self Importance</strong>

18. Comparing yourself to others
19. <em>“There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.” ―</em> Ernest Hemingway
20. The very idea, that there is no value in placing yourself above another is so simple, and so true and yet a world-view shattering idea
21. People believing that they earned what they have is destructive, that pride, that smugness, the expectation toward others, the lack of recognizing who has been part of your story, what resources you were gifted, how much you stand on the shoulders of others. First it’s fundamentally flawed as an idea, second it is the source of most hatred and misunderstandings toward others

<li>Conversation with Lexi - all opportunities come from negative things, the stoic idea that the obstacle is the way</li>
<li>My past failures are what allow my current freedom - I can move where and when I want because I didn’t succeed in starting a family, one of the things people are most envious of me for is directly due to my past failings</li>
<li>Learning is pruning and making neurons more efficient, more learning ability is a lack of efficiency, my forgetfulness is my superpower in my ability to learn things quickly</li>
<li>Rejection means freedom, and lack of a crappy situation, don’t ever see it as a negative it’s a waste to spend time where unwanted.</li>
<li>Bad situations lead to good ones, if we eliminate one we eliminate both</li>
<li>The opportunity in what we perceive to be negative, all greatness comes from what is hard, or uncomfortable</li>

12. Release buggy code and ship now when money is tight to fix later when money isn’t tight is actually less of a choice than you think
13. Should a laptop be repairable or should it be thin, should code be fast or understandable?
14. In what ways have I optimized my life for things in the past, to mitigate rejection and so I was shy? Perhaps I chose the wrong tradeoffs, it’s not too late</li>
<li><strong>Complexity and Abstraction</strong>
15. Complexity is never removed, it’s shifted or tucked away.
16. What is the appropriate level of abstraction?
1. Depends on the situation
17. Complexity and markov blankets, varying levels of abstraction to model simplicity

21. Broad strokes head in the right direction, find a path along the way, be willing to diverge
22. Often many good choices
23. There are two types of things - they do the job, or they don’t
3. Later you can find things that do it better, or don’t, That’s it
24. The right thing vs it’s all relative - I still don’t know the answer, perhaps there isn’t one, the very act of trying to answer it is in itself an irony like the whole “this statement is a lie”
25. No such thing as a best solution, only works, or doesn’t work inspired by “there are only two kinds of technology: the kind that serves people, and the useless kind - Not about numbers, features, and algorithms, but about happiness and people: problems solved, results delivered, needs addressed”
26. Doable actionable is better than good so long as it leans in the right direction</li>
<li><strong>Doubling Down Is Rarely The Right Answer</strong>
27. The difference between a hero and a villain is that a villain is unable to be wrong, that when faced with failure they double down on their one idea often taking it to an extreme, tragic heroes are much the same</li>

3. Find generous work that scares you, you learn to dance with the fear, use it as a reminder that you are on the right path
4. Teach how to lead and solve interesting problems - opposite of education system
5. Interesting problems = “I don’t know the answer to this, let&rsquo;s figure it out”

<ol>
<li><strong>Life Fundamentals First (Sleep, Diet, Stress) Cascade And Influence All Other Areas of Life</strong>
<ol>
<li>Holistic step ladder theory - improve sleep, then diet, they unlock the next tier of improvement, the next circle. Like you&rsquo;ve maxed out sleep improvement until you&rsquo;ve somewhat fixed your diet, so they are together some until the next tier. Meaning you improve a bit of each until you can further improve the one, they go together holistically.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Compounding Effects, Synergistic Effects and The Difficulty Of Knowing What’s Working Due To Complexity</strong>
2. Kaizen
3. Be like Dr Doom - Being the best hybrid of usefulness instead of the best at one thing

8. Networking is a path to better work, see also open door researchers who work on the right things even if they do less work
1. the milieu in which you exist - groups that help you refine and promote your work
2. The reason solo careers aren’t as good as bands is because they are creating in isolation, having someone to bounce ideas off of makes things better.

<li><strong>If It’s Worth Doing, It’s Worth Doing Poorly</strong></li>
<li>**Passion Isn’t Something You Have - It’s Learned, It’s Unlocked **
15. This is how it works for most people, you don’t love someone before you know them, likewise you don’t have passion for a field that you don’t yet know, these things take time, all you can hope for is an interest and a curiosity, and you should follow that until your understanding is deep enough.</li>
<li>**Don’t Follow Your Passion **
16. Passion is something used to enslave people, to underpay them, take advantage of them, it’s a predatory tool used against people.
17. Instead do something that you are good at, that you enjoy, but that you could walk away from so that you can put your loved ones first. Do passion things on the side.</li>
<li><strong>On Selling Out</strong>
18. You can be bored with having a greatest hits, or you can be pleased with it and build on it, be angry at the limits of success or use it to outgrow it, but honesty you can do that and innovate too.</li>
<li>**My Thesis On Luck And How To Influence It **
19. “Luck spread” - Increase the probability of the desired outcomes by going with the options that open up the most opportunities.

8. Example: can’t buy a house during a market crash due to not having liquid funds.
22. Lack of hard focus allows to notice things

33. Optimism - Free donuts or long lines, how do you see it?</li>
<li><strong>The True Nature of Risk</strong>
34. Taking Chances, what is risk, do we see risk differently from different perspectives? Often what we consider the riskier option is in fact the safer bet, how do we see it in a real way?

The Mona Lisa was never finished, and my life as the art that I mean it to be will never be finished until it is, when I die it will be done enough until then, life is art, and my life is my masterpiece.

<li>**Design Requires Confidence, Assertion, &amp; Decisiveness **</li>
<li><strong>When Decisions Are Made Design Is Happening, Make Sure It’s Good Design</strong>
6. Every programmer is a designer
7. Design happens whenever something is made, but good design is made with intention</li>
<li><strong>To Design Better Understand Better, Use Empathy, Ask Questions</strong></li>
<li><strong>Design As Fusion &amp; Mitigation - Design Is Combining Multiple Areas Of Expertise To Synthesize Solutions That Couldn’t Exist Otherwise &amp; To Deal With Complexity That Comes From Merging Multiple Areas of Expertise</strong>
8. Many separate disciplines
9. Optimizing priorities and objectives
10. Weighing different perspectives
11. Finding the right balance
12. Each discipline thinks their contribution the most important, the designer brings balance and coherence
13. Wholistic persuasion
14. Seeing the point of view of the user, the business(sales, manufacturing, distribution) and the maintainers</li>
<li>**Good Design Is An Understanding Of Psychology And Technology **
15. Communicates what is possible, what is happening and what is about to happen (perhaps also what has happened)
16. Great designers create pleasurable/frictionless/fun experiences
17. Broad technology; money, markets, language, not just computers and bits
18. There are different qualities of interactions
1. Understandability
2. Usability
3. Emotional impact
4. How it works, how it’s controlled, the interactions between things
19. Relational Objects
5. If a thing is dependent on the nature of both the user and the object then it’s not properties of the object its a relational object.</li>
<li>**Hard Structures &amp; Soft Structures **
20. whiteboard guards vs signs that ask you not to smear marker onto the walls
21. Technology Should Serve Man and Not Man Machine, expecting users to learn it is the opposite of this.
22. Human error and blame - soft systems vs hard systems</li>
<li>**Accept What Is - Errors Will Happen **
23. Design things such based on the assumption that people will make errors
6. Accept human behavior for what it is, instead of what we wish it was
7. People aren’t logical, and expecting them to be will only cause you pain
8. People Aren’t Rational
1. We do things for not the reasons we say we are doing them, we buy for a different than advertised purpose (with time money etc)
1. We stay at hostels to meet people
2. School isn’t about learning
3. Games aren’t about fun
2. Most Logic comes after the decision, not before it, we rationalize but emotions are what really drive us and what we do.
9. Even experts make errors
10. An organization that says there are no problems has big problems, one that admits the small ones works to fix them, if we say there are no errors being made or that they are just the fault of the user we are missing the opportunity to make things better
11. You need design for when things go wrong if everything went right all the time you wouldn’t need it.
12. Things never don’t have problems
24. The way engineers may overly rely on the intended user having logic, many designers likewise lean toward overly simplistic or overly pretty designs instead of ones that serve the user</li>

<li><strong>Signaling - Why We Wear The Clothes We Do, Use The Words We do</strong>
7. Why taking care of yourself matters
8. Honest signalling will help you find your tribe and will open doors
9. Poor signaling will either take you in the wrong direction or cause you to be rejected by those you tried to impress.
10. Why style can affect your opportunities?
11. Objects/props define and comfort us, show us what we value and what we need, who we think we are
12. Signaling is the wearing of markers of tribal affiliation, think sports fans or geeky t-shirts
2. Self selection bias based on taste and signaling
3. Signaling education, wealth, class and beliefs, all ways of demonstrating membership of a tribe
4. Marking themselves as separate, visual gimmicks to signify non-muggleness
5. The reason I don’t like bars is because I don’t feel like I’m part of that tribe

8. “Care enough to know the difference and to pay for it”
9. The artifact is a souvenir of the point</li>
<li><strong>What Is a Brand?</strong>
13. A brand is shorthand for feelings and experience
10. Some might also call it a promise.
14. “But the brands that matter are voices that choose to matter. Voices that make assertions on behalf of their users. Who market with people, and for them, not to them or at them” Seth Godin
15. Branding is who are you: what do you stand for, what feeling do you convey
11. What is your core value
12. People with passion can change the world - An old Apple Ad
13. Where do we fit in this world, what are we about?
1. It’s not about what you do well, it’s about something more, the core value, what you believe in, who your people are</li>
<li><strong>For every decision give reasoning “and here’s why”</strong></li>
<li><strong>Too Perfect Will Push People Away</strong>

5. I procrastinate because I don&rsquo;t believe in myself and my ability to make something good
1. I presume that what I make should be good, it should not

<li><strong>The Power of Play</strong></li>
<li><strong>“Art is not something that should be done well” - Cesar Aira</strong>
<ol>
<li>Art is experimental, never done before, exploratory, if you can do it well it’s not art, it’s a craft
<ol>
<li>When you feel it is something that should be done well, you craft it for selling, and make it into something that a buyer would buy, which makes it less art and more commission, nothing new is pioneered this way - make an automobile not a faster horse</li>
<li>Good art sets a new standard for what is to come, it isn’t something that conforms to pre existing standards - the difference of creation and production</li>

<li><strong>On Taste</strong>
10. Subtle things built up over time compounding toward success
3. Experience to know the nuance of what is good, to where it feels and seems natural
4. This is what good taste is?
11. Taste is the compounding effect of exposure and experience
12. “Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take a while. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.” ― Ira Glass</li>

9. What Is Optimal vs What is Needed, first get what’s needed, then work towards what is optimal
10. “First make it work, then make it beautiful, then if you really, really have to, make it fast. 90% of the time, if you make it beautiful, it will already be fast. So really, just make it beautiful” - Joe Armstrong</li>

<li><strong>On Nurturing Seeds And Exploring</strong></li>
<li><strong>Team Ups, Collaborations And Partnerships</strong>

4. In a partnership I need someone who knows that this needs to be done now so we can make money now then spend time fixing later when we have money, instead of my “wanting to plan ahead and make it all correct now while I’m there already”
16. Is honest critique a sign of respect for their professionalism or is it harsh?

<li>Sarcasm as a tool to fight authority while seeming submissive</li>
<li>Hive minds and breaking away from group think and circle jerks</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>My Theory Of Evil</strong>
5. Selfishness - the willing sacrifice the many for yourself or your group
1. Corruption - may be more natural than non corrupt, have to be vigilant
1. Cronyism might be the more default human act, pushing against corruption is unnatural and unselfish, a noble ideal but it has to be propped up with continual work, as humans will default back to destructive acts.
2. Civilization is an unselfish cooperative act, it’s the opposite of natural
2. Given enough time / dissonance people will default back to selfishness, this looks like tribalism and is the breakdown of societal agreements, the erosion of seeing others as part of you and yours, now to be seen as them and theirs.
6. Lack of long term thinking
7. Intentional misinformation - lying and the like
8. People can be in such pain that they forget that others are people
9. The scarier thought is not that the world is ending but that it was always shit and we are only now seeing it because the asshholes feel so empowered as to take action on their assholeness and to not have to hide it anymore
10. Debt is a leading cause of evil</li>
<li><strong>Meritocracy Is a Destructive Lie</strong>
11. Nobody exists in a vacuum, nobody’s life is completely their own.
12. Nobody earns all they have, they were given a lot by family, society, situations, and networks. To try to give them all the credit is a disservice to everyone. Give credit yes, but don’t make heros.
13. Usually when we set a standard we attract only those who will live up to it. If we set the wrong standard due to misunderstanding we are now stuck with a monoculture that does what we thought we needed instead of what we actually did.</li>
<li><strong>Modern Kingmakers and Where True Power Is</strong>
14. Software creators are both the tastemakers and the kingmakers of our day, this is where the real power is, or at least the best chance of achieving it
15. See how scribes used to function in older societies. - Look up Uncle Bob
16. The power of 40 years ago was in knowing people with power, 20 years ago in money. Now it’s in the ability to make things happen. Since the cost of things is down, money has lost a lot of its power, since influence is no longer as tightly controlled (social media etc) knowing people is less than it was. These are still useful, but diminished. Real power now looks more like someone who can make something themselves, recruit talented people to join them, and make enough money to get that change going. It looks more like a technical founder than someone from the hamptons.</li>
<li><strong>Gatekeepers</strong>
17. Traditional gatekeeping is a secretary that can’t get you an appointment “oops, sorry booked solid” but there are a lot of more subtle forms
18. Gatekeeping takes many forms, some are just more invisible than you think, the art community is proud of it’s inclusiveness but requires money/debt to get going. Requires fame and connections as much as talent, maybe more so. This is still gatekeeping
19. Cultural norms and shunning is gatekeeping too.</li>
<li>**You Probably Don’t Need That Seed Money &amp; Other Bootstrapping Ideals **

<li>Limited Freedom (Just enough) as a means of control
<ol>
<li>A large meadow controls a sheep, golden handcuffs are real some freedom goes a long way</li>
<li>Do we act like consumers of things that would be odd to think about that way, like how we treat free speech, or freedom? Are we just consuming it?</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>**Asking the Question “Who Benefits From This?” **
2. Can be a deep rabbit hold deep dive that can end up explaining a lot of how a thing is and why</li>
<li>**No Such Thing As Heroes or Villains, Only People **
3. The most famous and the worst people are usually the same person. Someone who did some good things mixed with bad, often the good happened with the bad or because of it. It’s hard to seperate it out sometimes.
4. Ford gave us assembly lines, minimum wages and weekends. He also did some terrible things in south america, and was an unashamed bigot.</li>
<li>**Coming To Terms With How Society Has Benefited From Violence **
5. Can we ever truly remove ourselves from violence? What about the old benefits we have received from it? The internet was a military project, so was gps, so were airplanes, roads, trains, most infrastructure exists for the purpose of military applications. What do we do with that? How do we come to terms with the medical knowledge accrued by nazi’s from killing and disecting political dissenters and persecuted peoples?</li>
<li><strong>Oppression Shapes Strategies of Success In An Unseen Logical Way - Why Inner City Kids Try to Be Rappers &amp; Athletes</strong>
6. The Armenian Genocide and the splitting of a people
7. Why “Ethnic” classes lean toward different asset types than those in power
8. Oppressed people are restricted in what they can do for a living since they can’t usually own land, or due to hatred have to move a lot or be ready to. That’s why so many go into trades, that’s why so many jews in pre nazi germany were doctors, jewellers and bankers, because those were the only high paying careers they were allowed to do because of the restrictions placed on them before. Similar to african americans going into sports, music or fashion. These are formerly/currently subjugated peoples, who are limited in what opportunities they can chase, and so they chase the ones they can. Which is why it might make more sense for a kid to work on his rap career instead of going to college.</li>
<li><strong>There Is Kind of Logic To What We Consider Illogical Behavior</strong>
9. There is a reason illegal immigrants from Mexico put all their money into pickup trucks, because if they get shipped away they can take that with them, a house not so much. Poor people use smoking as a pick me up, fat people eat what their body craves due to hormone signaling. Look deeper and things make more sense.</li>

2. On heteronormativity of thinking and background, and the way it is with thinking, how ADD might just be a different way to think (neurodiversity) the idea. What if the diversity of income experience matters too, what if our colleges being as they are searching for straight A students has inadvertently removed an important form of diversity of thought from the stream, one that matters, or would have mattered. What about those who just feel stifled by the structure of school, what if they had learned the things you could have learned at college, what kind of world would we live in, how much better the ideas could have been.

<li>**Is it Really a Threat or are You Insecure? **
4. What does it mean if someone or something feels threatening, is it competence, an actual threat or a manifestation of my own insecurities

5. It’s about solving the problem the best way that we can, not about doing things the way we want to do them</li>
<li><strong>Is Blame Ever Helpful? Is It Even Accurate?</strong>
6. If an employee fails, it is usually due to poor leadership, either leadership hired the wrong person, didn’t grow the talent right, didn’t allow for better communication. Blaming them, unless they were malicious is misplaced at best, destructive at worst
7. To paraphrase Nancy Leveson, one of the foremost safety researchers alive: when an accident is caused by not following procedure, we blame the operator for being too careless. When an accident is caused by following procedure, we blame them for being to rigid
8. A lot of what we place blame on is actually a systemic problem, often the victims of the systemic problems are the ones who take the brunt of the blame.
9. Toyota always reviews if the system is at fault even if it was an operator error.</li>

</ol>
<h2 id="perspectives-on-the-workings-of-the-world">Perspectives On The Workings Of The World</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Nuances of Conflict, Most Solutions Cause Other Problems</strong>
<ol>
<li>I’m starting to entertain the idea that some problems can’t be solved, mostly because the definition of “problem” was too strict. Most things are features in service of different goals or peoples. To overcome a problem would be to cause a problem for another perhaps. That doesn’t mean I don’t believe in doing nothing, but to look before I leap. Often there are mutually beneficial solutions that just aren’t thought of at first.</li>
<li>The quest for utopia, causes the dystopia, or better put the utopia of one group of people is the dystopia for another. Because we can’t serve everyone properly to make it perfect for one would only be at the expense of another.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>True Leadership Is Support, To Serve And Not Be Served</strong></li>
<li><strong>Prestige Is Just Approval From Those In Power</strong>
3. What if the prestige we seek, since it is in a way approval from those in power, is actually almost evil in a way. There are some people I don’t want their approval and would be concerned if they gave it (like Trump). So I wonder, is going somewhere like Stanford or working for Google the same thing but in a more subtle way? What if the things I wanted were wrong to want, what if those in power should not be appeased but undermined and disempowered. What if I’ve been supporting a system that should have been toppled instead of appeased. I don’t believe in violent revolution, but I do believe in disruption. Maybe I shouldn’t work for Google, maybe I should take them down instead.
4. Most of what is polite is actually recognition of power Dynamics and supplication toward it. Allowing it to continue in power. Often those who don’t recognize this make those in power uncomfortable. This was why people complained about football players kneeling during national anthems.
5. Awards Ceremonies are rigged for the benefit of the giver more than the receiver.
6. TV Guide skews to favor the owner of the magazine
7. Going to a fancy college or working for a fancy company doesn’t actually make you more useful
8. Prestige is measuring yourself against others, it’s envy and destructive</li>
<li><strong>Wealth And Money Are Not To Be Respected</strong>
9. Why does your money mean I should respect you? Your past successes earned or inherited, why do those give you any edge over me except where you understand something better?</li>
<li><strong>Glamor Is A Lie - Most of What We Hold In High Esteem Is Boring</strong>
10. Famous people spend so much time and money on keeping up appearances that it’s almost all they can do, looking up to them for this isn’t worth the effort.
11. Data Scientists Showed me what they do, it’s not sexy
12. Bodybuilders are the most boring people you will ever meet.</li>
<li><strong>Beliefs Are Maintained Because They Are Identity - Why People Hold On To What They Know Is Not True</strong>

3. why do you live in the city, neighborhood or country that you do?
4. A Nation/Neighborhood as a kind of brand</li>
<li>**On Not Dismissing Ideas Too Quickly **
5. many of the french existentialists didn’t want to be labeled as that, which I think for the sake of a movement was destructive but the idea is interesting. I think about how a lot of our thinking today politically is either a liberal or progressive idea versus a conservative one. I follow and respect many people who do have more conservative leaning ideas, and most of the time I don’t believe them, but sometimes I’m not so sure I’m right. For example nuclear power, I have concerns about nuclear power, but I also recognize that we aren’t properly equipped to power every vehicle if we all switched to electric, less so if we eliminate coal and natural gas as we would like to. In my mind nuclear is a conservative driven idea, but I also recognize that it is 90% environmentally friendly. It’s not a pure solution, but perhaps it’s a turn the tide momentarily solution (plus what about the eagles that die from wind farms etc), so I don’t think I can be against it. But back to the actual thought, that perhaps the labeling and categorizing of ideas is doing more damage than the ideas themselves. I nearly dismissed an idea today proposed by one of my living heroes because I recognized it on gut reaction as one that conservatives push. I think the idea may still be wrong, but I’m more troubled by my gut reaction because of what groups of people have claimed as intellectually theirs. I believe in free ideas that spread organically and freely, that can cross pollinate and be used to create the best solutions. If I am being prejudiced toward an idea because someone I usually disagree with has placed some claim on it then I have two disagreements. 1. How dare they claim it, nobody has a right to claim it and 2. I should disagree with the idea itself, not with the person presenting it.</li>
