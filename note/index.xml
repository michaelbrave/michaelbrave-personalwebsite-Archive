      <description>If it Pisses You Off, There’s a Bit Of Truth in it, Usually&amp;hellip;
It hits hard because you know you should have taken care of it already
A hard truth that needs to be faced

      <description>Our Flaws Make Us Better - Why It’s Ok for Smart People to Do Dumb Things
I&amp;rsquo;m always shocked when people I admire do dumb things, but never when I do. I don&amp;rsquo;t even look down on them, it&amp;rsquo;s just an “oh, that&amp;rsquo;s odd”. We are all just human. It&amp;rsquo;s better this way
Art Shapes Our Values - Our Surroundings Influence Us

There Is Value In Stating The Obvious
Common Sense is a Lie

      <description>Non-Attachment and Letting Go - Our Expectations are the Painful Part
Goodbyes as an Act of Love - Ash and freeing his pokemon, because he really cared about them

      <description>Tragedy and Loss Should Be Treated As the Catalysts of Choice, Show Your Cards or Don’t
