      <description>One of the most productive things I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to do has been to cut things out of my life because they weren&amp;rsquo;t the most important. Focus is as much what you don&amp;rsquo;t do as what you do. So it becomes even more important to recognize and prioritize the things that actually matter, especially if these are along the important and impactful but not urgent spectrum.
So then I have to ask myself, what are the things that actually matter?</description>

      <title>Awe, Wonder &amp; Pleasant Surprises</title>

      <description>Cultivating curiosity and wonder are what allow me to be productive, to get things done and to keep procrastination at bay, I find that they are also core emotions to my functioning well as a person and key my own happiness or contentment.
I believe that the distillation of it is feedback and enjoying that feedback. Look at a baby splashing water, they are surprised by how their actions caused a reaction, they are surprised and often delighted by that direct feedback.</description>

      <title>If It&#39;s Worth Doing Well, It&#39;s Worth Doing Poorly</title>

      <description>I once heard a saying that if &amp;ldquo;something is worth doing well, then it&amp;rsquo;s worth doing poorly&amp;rdquo; in this particular case it was in reference to keeping a diet and was along the lines of &amp;ldquo;done is better than perfect&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;better something than nothing&amp;rdquo;. So keeping with the diet example, every time I&amp;rsquo;ve failed at keeping a diet it&amp;rsquo;s been something along the lines of quitting because &amp;ldquo;I already messed up yesterday&amp;rdquo;, while the times I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to keep a diet were the times I was allowed to make mistakes, or when I had already factored in something like a cheat day.</description>

      <title>Build in the open</title>
      <link>https://michaelbrave.github.io/note/build-in-the-open/</link>

      <description>Why have my notes be public? This is in large part due to two different ideas.
The first is that building in the open aka building with the garage door open allows for better feedback loops with other people. People can tell me where/how I&amp;rsquo;m wrong, maybe my wisdom/failing can help someone else, those who are curious about me can know what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking and instead of having something private I can instead be building a kind of resource that could create a kind of creation momentum.</description>
